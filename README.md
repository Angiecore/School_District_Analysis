# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to replace the math scores and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs because the data is doubtful.

## Results

Only math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School data portion was removed. Thus, the data did not change a lot from the original analysis.
