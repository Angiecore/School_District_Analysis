# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to replace the math scores and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs because the data is doubtful. The data contains student ID, student name, gender, grades, reading score, math score, school name, school ID, school type, size and budget.

## Results

### District Summary

Only math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School data portion was removed. Thus, the data did not change a lot from the original analysis. As we can see in the images below the the math passing percentage dropped 0.2% and the reading passing percentage dropped 0.3%.

Replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores did not affect Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools. It kept as second place after all.
